## Why another generator when you have JHipster?
JHipster is an amazing SpringBoot application generator with lots and lots of cool features.
However, there are certain JHipster features that does not fit for my preferences such as:

1. I like *jar* packaging
2. I like to use spring-boot-starter-* than configuring individual libraries
3. I like to have an option to generate application without spring-security
4. I prefer Flyway to Liquibase
5. I like to have only minimum and required configuration ie no AsyncConfiguration, LocaleConfiguration, CacheConfiguration, Logstash Logging etc.
6. I like .properties over .yml

## Local Development Setup

```
> git clone https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/generator-springboot.git
> cd generator-springboot
> npm install 
> npm link
> yo springboot
```
