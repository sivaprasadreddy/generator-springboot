# Migration from JavaScript to TypeScript

This document outlines the migration strategy from JavaScript to TypeScript for the `generator-springboot` project.

## Current Status

The project has been successfully migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript:
- TypeScript source files are in the `src/` directory
- TypeScript compiler outputs JavaScript and declaration files to the `generators/` directory
- Duplicate JavaScript files have been removed

## Migration Steps

### 1. TypeScript Files

The following files have been migrated to TypeScript:

- `src/app/index.ts` (replaces `generators/app/index.js`)
- `src/common/base-generator.ts` (replaces `generators/common/base-generator.js` and `generators/base-generator.js`)
- `src/common/constants.ts` (replaces `generators/common/constants.js` and `generators/constants.js`)
- `src/controller/index.ts` (replaces `generators/controller/index.js`)
- `src/server/index.ts` (replaces `generators/server/index.js`)
- `src/server/prompts.ts` (replaces `generators/server/prompts.js`)

### 2. Files Deleted

The following JavaScript files have been deleted as they've been migrated to TypeScript:

- ✅ `generators/common/constants.js` - DELETED 
- ✅ `generators/constants.js` - DELETED
- ✅ `generators/common/base-generator.js` - DELETED
- ✅ `generators/base-generator.js` - DELETED

### 3. Path Resolution Improvements

We've implemented robust path resolution methods for the generators to handle template paths correctly regardless of how they're invoked:

- `server/index.ts` and `controller/index.ts` both override the `templatePath` method
- Each generator uses dynamic path resolution with fallback options
- This ensures templates work whether called from the app generator or directly

### 4. Manual Testing Completed

We've successfully tested both generators with Yeoman:

- ✅ `yo springboot` - Successfully created a new Spring Boot project with Gradle + MariaDB + Flyway
- ✅ `yo springboot:controller` - Successfully added a Product entity with associated files

### 5. Steps to Complete the Migration

1. ✅ Build the TypeScript code: `npm run build`
2. ✅ Run tests: `npm test`
3. ✅ Delete the original JavaScript files: `npm run cleanup:js`
4. ✅ Rebuild the TypeScript code: `npm run build`
5. ✅ Manually test with Yeoman: `npm link && yo springboot`

You can run automated tests with: `npm run migrate`

### 6. Manual Testing Instructions

To manually verify the generator works with Yeoman:

```bash
# Link the generator locally
npm link

# Run the generator
yo springboot

# Follow the prompts to generate a project
# Options to test:
# - Different databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB)
# - Different build tools (Maven, Gradle)
# - Different features (ELK, Monitoring, Localstack)

# Test the controller generator
cd your-generated-project
yo springboot:controller EntityName

# Verify the generated files
# Check that the project builds and runs correctly
```

## Migration Status Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Base Generator | ✅ Completed | Migrated to TypeScript and tested |
| Constants | ✅ Completed | Migrated to TypeScript and tested |
| App Generator | ✅ Completed | Migrated to TypeScript and tested |
| Server Generator | ✅ Completed | Migrated to TypeScript and tested |
| Controller Generator | ✅ Completed | Migrated to TypeScript and tested |
| Tests | ⚠️ Pending | Tests are still in JavaScript, but work with TypeScript-generated code |
| Documentation | ✅ Updated | README.md and MIGRATION.md updated |
| Manual Testing | ✅ Completed | Successfully tested with Yeoman |

## Future Tasks

1. Migrate test files to TypeScript: The test files (`test/controller.spec.js` and `test/server.spec.js`) are currently in JavaScript. These can be migrated to TypeScript in a future update.

2. Add stronger typing for generator options: While the basic TypeScript migration is complete, there's room to improve type definitions for generator options and configuration parameters.

3. Update CI/CD pipelines: Ensure CI/CD pipelines are updated to handle TypeScript compilation steps.

## Best Practices

- Keep template paths consistent between JavaScript and TypeScript code
- Ensure proper typing for generator options and configuration
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing generators
- Test thoroughly after each migration step
- When adding new generators, follow the same pattern of overriding templatePath for robust path resolution
